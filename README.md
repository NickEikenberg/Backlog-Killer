# Backlog-Killer

Backlog Killer is site where you can keep track of your current video game catalogue! Add games to your backlog, and when you (finally) get around to playing a game, add it to your Now Playing section. Once you finish it, add it to your Finished page so you can see all the games you've finished

## How It Works

Games are loaded on the Index page. The user can either check out each games individual Show page where they can add it to their backlog or just add the game to their backlog directly from the Index page. Users can then access their backlog from their user page. Games in the users backlog can be added to the Now Playing section from here.
